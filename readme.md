# Learn Express: Routes

Introduction
A huge portion of the Internetâ€™s data travels over HTTP/HTTPS through request-response cycles between clients and servers. Every time that you use a website, your browser sends requests to one or many servers requesting resources. Every image, meme, post, and video is requested by a client and sent in a response from a server.

Express is a powerful but flexible Javascript framework for creating web servers and APIs. It can be used for everything from simple static file servers to JSON APIs to full production servers.
